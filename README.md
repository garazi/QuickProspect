# QuickProspect

A component that provides a form to add a new Prospect and associate it with a Property in the Dreamhouse app. Use the Deploy button to create the two Custom Objects (Prospect__c and ProspectAssociation__c). Note: this only works with the Dreamhouse app which can be installed from dreamhouseapp.io.
